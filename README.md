### 📋 Project Scope

This project's primary goal is to create a **responsive, mobile-first dashboard screen** for a pet management application ("PetHealthConnect"). The scope for this UI Template Milestone (MS1) includes building the interface using **native UI components** (or equivalents, e.g., using frameworks like Flutter/React Native for UI structure) and modern layout techniques.

The core UI must include the following native components and structures, based entirely on the linked Figma design:

1.  **Top Navigation Bar:** Includes User Profile/Avatar and Notification Icon.
2.  **Primary Action Grid/Cards:** A grid or stacked card layout for the main functional tabs (e.g., Appointments, Messages, Reminders).
3.  **Health Metrics Section:** Uses a clear **Stack View** or arrangement to display fixed data (e.g., Current Weight, Vitals, Activity).
4.  **Bottom Tab Bar:** A persistent navigation bar at the bottom for main screen switching (e.g., Dashboard, My Pets).
5.  **Data List Views:** Use of scrollable list or collection views for displaying items like "Upcoming Appointments" and the "My Pets" list.

### 🗓️ Development Timeline

This project was completed by a sole contributor (Ivan Gabriel Abrera), who assumed all roles (Designer, Mobile Developer, QA Tester).

* **Project Setup & Components (Day 1):** Configured the development environment, created the main **View Controller** (or **View**), and structured the primary layout containers.
* **UI Implementation (Day 2-3):** Implemented all UI components using **Auto Layout** (for UIKit) or **VStack/HStack** (for SwiftUI/framework equivalent) to ensure responsiveness on different screen sizes.
* **Styling & Finalization (Day 4):** Applied final colors, fonts, and verified the template for compliance with **Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)** or **Material Design** principles.
