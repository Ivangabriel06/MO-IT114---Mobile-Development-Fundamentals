### 📋 Project Scope

This project's primary goal is to create a **responsive, mobile-first dashboard screen** for a pet management application ("Elijah"). The scope for this UI Template Milestone (MS1) includes building the interface using **native UI components** and modern layout techniques.

The core UI must include the following native components and structures, based entirely on the linked Figma design:

1.  **Top Navigation Bar:** Includes User Profile/Avatar and Notification Icon.
2.  **Primary Action Grid:** A grid or stack view layout for the four main functional tabs (e.g., Health Data, Pets).
3.  **Recommended Products Section:** Displays scrollable product cards (e.g., using a **CollectionView** or **LazyVGrid** in SwiftUI).
4.  **Health Metrics Section:** Uses a clear **Stack View** or **HStack/VStack** to display fixed data (Weight, Activity, Vitals).
5.  **Reviews/Testimonials:** Uses containers for text and star icons.

### 🗓️ Development Timeline

This project was completed by a sole contributor (Ivan Gabriel Abrera), who assumed all roles (Designer, Mobile Developer, QA Tester).

* **Project Setup & Components (Day 1):** Configured the development environment, created the main **View Controller** (or **View**), and structured the primary layout containers.
* **UI Implementation (Day 2-3):** Implemented all UI components using **Auto Layout** (for UIKit) or **VStack/HStack** (for SwiftUI) to ensure responsiveness on different screen sizes (e.g., iPhone SE vs. iPad).
* **Styling & Finalization (Day 4):** Applied final colors, fonts, and verified the template for compliance with **Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)** or **Material Design**.
